  Here's a comparison of some popular JavaScript libraries: **jQuery**, **React**, **Lodash**, and **D3.js**, including some basic code examples and a table that highlights their key differences.

### Code Examples:

#### 1. **jQuery:**
jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX interactions.

\`\`\`javascript
// jQuery example: Hiding an element on button click
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("#hideButton").click(function() {
    $("#elementToHide").hide();
  });
});
\`\`\`

#### 2. **React:**
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.

\`\`\`javascript
// React example: Displaying a message
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
\`\`\`

#### 3. **Lodash:**
Lodash is a utility library that provides functions for common programming tasks like working with arrays, objects, and functions.

\`\`\`javascript
// Lodash example: Using _.map to iterate over an array
const _ = require('lodash');

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = _.map(numbers, num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled);  // [2, 4, 6]
\`\`\`

#### 4. **D3.js:**
D3.js is a powerful library for creating data visualizations in the browser.

\`\`\`javascript
// D3.js example: Creating a simple bar chart
const data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

const svg = d3.select("body").append("svg")
  .attr("width", 500)
  .attr("height", 500);

svg.selectAll("rect")
  .data(data)
  .enter().append("rect")
  .attr("x", (d, i) => i * 60)
  .attr("y", d => 500 - d)
  .attr("width", 50)
  .attr("height", d => d)
  .attr("fill", "blue");
\`\`\`

Inline math example: \\( E = mc^2 \\)

Block math example:
\\[
  f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} \\, d\\xi
\\]

To prove that \\( 100n + 2 \\leq O(n) \\) , we need to understand the concept of **Big-O notation** and how it works.

### Big-O Notation:
- **Big-O notation** describes an upper bound on the growth rate of a function as its input size grows.
- \( f(n) = O(g(n)) \) means there exist constants \( c > 0 \) and \( n_0 \) such that for all \( n \geq n_0 \), \\( f(n) \\leq c \\cdot g(n) \\).

In this case, we want to prove that \( 100n + 2 \) is in the class \( O(n) \). This means we need to show that \( 100n + 2 \) grows at most as fast as a constant multiple of \( n \) as \( n \) grows large.

Inline math example: \\( E = mc^2 \\)

### Proof:

We want to show that:

\\[
100n + 2 \\leq c \\cdot n
\\]

for some constant \\( c \\) and for sufficiently large \( n \).

1. **Rewrite the expression**:  
   We start with the expression \( 100n + 2 \). We need to show that this is bounded by some multiple of \( n \).

2. **Choose a constant \( c \)**:  
   We can try to find a constant \( c \) such that for sufficiently large \( n \), \( 100n + 2 \leq c \cdot n \). 

   Letâ€™s manipulate the inequality:

   \\[
   100n + 2 \leq c \cdot n
   \\]

   Divide both sides by \( n \) (for \( n > 0 \)):

   \\[
   100 + \\frac{2}{n} \\leq c
   \\]

3. **Find the value of \( c \)**:  
   As \\( n \\) grows larger, \\( \\frac{2}{n} \\) approaches 0. So, for large enough \( n \), we can make \( 100 + \frac{2}{n} \) arbitrarily close to 100. Therefore, we can choose \( c = 101 \), and for sufficiently large \( n \), this inequality holds.

   Specifically, for \( n \geq 1 \), we can see that:

   \[
   100 + \frac{2}{n} \leq 101
   \]

   So, the inequality holds for \( c = 101 \) and for all \( n \geq 1 \).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Therefore, we have shown that there exist constants \( c = 101 \) and \( n_0 = 1 \) such that:

   \[
   100n + 2 \leq 101 \cdot n
   \]

   This proves that \( 100n + 2 \) is \( O(n) \), because we have demonstrated that it is bounded above by a constant multiple of \( n \) for large enough \( n \).

### Final Answer:
\[
100n + 2 \leq O(n)
\]
is true, because we found that \( 100n + 2 \) grows at most linearly with \( n \), and is therefore in the set \( O(n) \).

---

### **2. Basic Chatbot Development**

Start by creating a simple chatbot. At this stage, you will learn how to integrate basic AI models for general conversation and how they respond to user queries.

#### **Topics to Learn:**
- **Introduction to Chatbots:** Learn the basic types of chatbots (rule-based, retrieval-based, generative-based).
- **Basic Chatbot with OpenAI API:** Use OpenAI's API to create a basic conversational assistant.

---

### **5. Handling Advanced Tasks and Multi-Step Workflows**

When building a task-oriented assistant (e.g., booking a flight), youâ€™ll need to design multi-step workflows and handle more complex user interactions.

#### **Topics to Learn:**
- **Dialog Management:** Design multi-turn conversations where the assistant needs to guide the user through a series of steps (e.g., booking flight -> selecting dates -> selecting passengers).
- **State Management:** Use state management to handle the flow of a task (e.g., tracking the status of the booking process).
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Ensure the assistant can handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid dates or payment failures).
- **Personalization:** Implement personalized responses based on user data or preferences.
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Improve your assistantâ€™s ability to understand user intent and extract structured data from unstructured input.
