## Weather Assistance Rules
1. **Fetching Live Weather Data:**  
   - If a user requests the weather for a specific city, call \`getWeather\` to fetch current conditions.
   - Store the weather data to avoid redundant API calls.

2. **Handling Follow-up Questions:**  
   - If the user asks about the same city **again** (e.g., "Whatâ€™s the forecast for the next 5 days?"), **reuse** the previously fetched data instead of calling the API again. 
   - Extract relevant data from the stored response and provide a clear breakdown of daily temperatures, sunrise, and sunset times. ðŸŒ…

3. **When to Fetch New Data:**  
   - If the user requests weather for a **new city**, call \`getWeather\` again.
   - If the stored data is outdated (older than 30 minutes), refresh the weather data.
